# Healthcare Platform Threat Model

## System Overview

The AI-driven healthcare booking platform handles sensitive patient health information (PHI) and requires robust security controls to protect against various threat vectors.

## Assets

### High Value Assets
- **Patient Health Information (PHI)**
  - Medical records, test results, prescriptions
  - Demographics and contact information
  - Appointment history and notes

- **Authentication Credentials**
  - User passwords and tokens
  - API keys and service credentials
  - Database connection strings

- **Business Logic**
  - AI recommendation algorithms
  - Pricing and billing information
  - Provider network data

## Threat Actors

### External Threats
- **Cybercriminals**: Financial motivation, ransomware
- **Nation-State Actors**: Espionage, data theft
- **Hacktivists**: Disruption, data exposure
- **Script Kiddies**: Opportunistic attacks

### Internal Threats
- **Malicious Insiders**: Employees with access
- **Negligent Users**: Accidental data exposure
- **Third-Party Vendors**: Supply chain risks

## STRIDE Analysis

### Spoofing
**Threats:**
- User impersonation through stolen credentials
- API endpoint spoofing
- Certificate spoofing

**Mitigations:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Certificate pinning in mobile app
- JWT token validation with short expiry
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Tampering
**Threats:**
- Database record modification
- API request/response tampering
- Mobile app binary modification

**Mitigations:**
- Database encryption at rest
- API request signing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Code signing for mobile app
- Integrity checks on critical data

### Repudiation
**Threats:**
- Users denying actions
- Lack of audit trail
- Log tampering

**Mitigations:**
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Digital signatures for critical actions
- Immutable log storage
- Non-repudiation mechanisms

### Information Disclosure
**Threats:**
- PHI exposure through API
- Database dumps
- Log file exposure
- Memory dumps containing sensitive data

**Mitigations:**
- Field-level encryption for PHI
- API response filtering
- Log sanitization
- Memory protection
- Network segmentation

### Denial of Service
**Threats:**
- API flooding
- Database connection exhaustion
- Resource exhaustion attacks

**Mitigations:**
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Circuit breakers
- DDoS protection (CloudFlare/AWS Shield)
- Resource quotas

### Elevation of Privilege
**Threats:**
- Privilege escalation through vulnerabilities
- Admin account compromise
- Container escape

**Mitigations:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security updates
- Container security scanning
- Network policies

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient Data Breach
**Attack Vector:** SQL injection in search API
**Impact:** Exposure of patient records
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Mitigations:**
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation
- Database user permissions
- WAF rules

### Scenario 2: Account Takeover
**Attack Vector:** Credential stuffing attack
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to patient accounts
**Likelihood:** High
**Mitigations:**
- Account lockout policies
- CAPTCHA on login
- Anomaly detection
- MFA enforcement

### Scenario 3: Ransomware Attack
**Attack Vector:** Phishing email with malware
**Impact:** System encryption and data loss
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Mitigations:**
- Employee security training
- Email filtering
- Endpoint protection
- Regular backups
- Network segmentation

## Security Controls

### Preventive Controls
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Detective Controls
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)
- Log analysis and SIEM
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Audit logging

### Corrective Controls
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Patch management
- Security updates
- Rollback capabilities

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA
- Administrative safeguards
- Physical safeguards
- Technical safeguards
- Breach notification procedures

### GDPR
- Data protection by design
- Right to erasure
- Data portability
- Consent management
